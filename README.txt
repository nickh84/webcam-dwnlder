This project was created for my need of a program that can periodically download
webcam images, store them according to time/date downloaded, and be able to make
a timelapse video of the downloaded images. I have searched for a program that filled
these requirements, but either they cost money or didnt include my requirements.

I have chosen to keep this project opensource and available to anyone. To anyone that
looks through the code, I will warn that I do not have the greatest programming
experience. This project is not only a creation of something I needed, but also a
learning experience for me.

This program depends on:

QT 4.8 (Currently built using QT Creator 2.4.1)
FFMpeg (Win32 Build Used: FFmpeg git-a254452 - compiled 2011-09-19)
QTFFMpegWrapper (http://code.google.com/p/qtffmpegwrapper)
